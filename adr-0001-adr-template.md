# ADR 0001: ADR Template

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Dash architectural decisions need to be better documented for efficiency in coordination and communication. Ideally, this will be done in a lightweight fashion that encourages expanded documentation without being overly burdensome.

## Decision

It makes sense to build on the work of others that have implemented an ADR process. For this reason, the template in [docs/template.md](./docs/template.md) is proposed as a simple, [commonly used](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/blob/main/templates/decision-record-template-by-michael-nygard/index.md) ADR template.

## Consequences

Having a pre-defined template provides a starting place for anyone writing an ADR and results in uniformity across ADRs.
