## Context

<!-- What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?-->

Dash architectural decisions need to be better documented for efficiency in coordination and
communication. Ideally, this will be done in a lightweight fashion that encourages expanded
documentation without being overly burdensome.

## Decision

<!-- What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing? -->

It makes sense to build on the work of others that have implemented an ADR process. For this reason,
the template in [template/adr-template.md](./template/adr-template.md) is proposed as a simple, [commonly
used](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/blob/main/templates/decision-record-template-by-michael-nygard/index.md)
ADR template.

## Consequences

<!-- What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change? -->

Having a pre-defined template provides a starting place for anyone writing an ADR and results in
uniformity across ADRs.
